## ✔AIM 

The Aim of this community is to help 10k people/students in tech. Many students are not aware of the tech, and need some mentorship, we as a community can do our part.
They have all the resources on Google/Internet but they don't know how can they **effectively** use them.

## 💡Idea behind this Community

As I am a graduate now, I have seen my growth this year due to the following reasons:
1. Community
2. Networking
3. Writing technical blogs
4. Teaching students
5. Public Speaking

I knew all of these from the very start, but I was afraid to get out of my comfort zone, and I feel many students feel the same, so I thought why not help people to get comfortable with all of this.

## 📆Plans for the Community

Till now, I have thought of providing some sessions to grow students, about:
1. Public Speaking
2. Starting technical blogs
3. Sharing their language (I think this is the best way to learn)
4. Working in teams

## 🔮Future Plans

To be discussed.
